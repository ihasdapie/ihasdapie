### Hi! I'm Brian.

I’m a student at the University of Toronto Engineering Science program passionate about **identifying problems** in the world around me and **creating solutions** for them. When I’m not cramming for school, I enjoy cooking and playing badminton.

What I'm working on right now: 
- [the Humerus Bot](https://utmist.gitlab.io/projects/humerus) A NLP NN designed to win Cards Against Humanity, a popular humor-based party game. 
- Web dev & data collection contracting for BC Parks Foundation: coming soon(?)
- aUToronto Systems & Simulations team
- trying to make it through university!

Check out some of my projects:
1. [GrocerCheck](https://grocercheck.ca): A web app with live grocery store busyness to help people socially distance effectively during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
2. Butternut: A chrome extension that uses predictive text generation models to detect ai-generated text
3. SSigVer: A siamese neural net for signature authentication.
