### Hi!, I'm Brian.

I’m a student at the University of Toronto Engineering Science program passionate about **identifying problems** in the world around me and **creating solutions** for them. When I’m not cramming for school, I enjoy cooking and playing badminton.

What I'm working on right now:
- Data collection & visualization & full-stack web dev contracting for BC Parks Foundation -- launching soon! 
- [the Humerus Bot](https://utmist.gitlab.io/projects/humerus) A NLP NN designed to win Cards Against Humanity, a popular humor-based party game. 
- aUToronto Systems Team: sssh!
- trying to make it through university!

Check out some of my projects:
1. GrocerCheck: A web app with live grocery store busyness to help people socially distance effectively during the COVID-19 pandemic.
2. [chenbrian.ca](https://chenbrian.ca) My personal website & blog
3. SSigVer: A siamese neural net for signature authentication.
